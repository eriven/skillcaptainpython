Variable is a reusable container for storing a value .<br />
A variable behaves as if it were the value it contains.<br />
Data types in python:<br />
int: Represents whole numbers without decimal points. It could be negative or positive.<br />
float: Represents decimal numbers. Simply numbers with a fractional part.<br />
str: Represents sequences of characters (text!).<br />
bool: Represents logical values, True or False.<br />
list: Represents ordered collections of elements.<br />
tuple: Represents ordered but not so changable collections of elements.<br />
dict: Represents key-value pairs in a dictionary.<br />
set: Represents unordered collections of unique elements.<br />
byte: Represents a sequence of bytes, typically used for storing binary data.
<br />
Just try to remember the name and you will be able to learn where they are used as you will be using them. <br />

Operators <br />
Operators are used to perform operations on values or variables. Python provides various types of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and more.
<br />
Arithmetic Operators:<br />
Addition (+): Adds two values.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one value from another.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values.
Division (/): Divides one value by another.
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of division.
Exponentiation (**): Raises a value to a power.
Floor Division (//): Returns the integer quotient of division.
<br />
Comparison Operators:<br />
Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
Greater than (>): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
Less than (<): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.
<br />
Logical Operators:<br />
And (and): Returns True if both operands are True.
Or (or): Returns True if either of the operands is True.
Not (not): Returns the opposite of the operand's logical value.
<br />
Assignment Operators:<br />
Assigns a value to a variable. Example: x = 5
<br />
Condition:<br />
Conditions allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain criteria. In Python, conditions are expressed using if, elif, and else statements.
<br />

    if condition1:
        # code to be executed if condition1 is true
    elif condition2:
        # code to be executed if condition2 is true but condition1 is not true
    elif condition3:
        # code to be executed if condition3 is true but condition1 and condition2 are not true
    else:
        # code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
<br />
In conditions, you can use comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) to compare values, logical operators (and, or, not) to combine conditions, and other techniques to make complex comparisons.
<br />
Example:
<br />

    if 2 != 2:
    	print("This is stupid")
    else:
    	print("Not so stupid!!") <br />
