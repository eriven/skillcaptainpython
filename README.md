Variable is a reusable container for storing a value .
A variable behaves as if it were the value it contains.
Data types in python:
int: Represents whole numbers without decimal points. It could be negative or positive.
float: Represents decimal numbers. Simply numbers with a fractional part.
str: Represents sequences of characters (text!).
bool: Represents logical values, True or False.
list: Represents ordered collections of elements.
tuple: Represents ordered but not so changable collections of elements.
dict: Represents key-value pairs in a dictionary.
set: Represents unordered collections of unique elements.
byte: Represents a sequence of bytes, typically used for storing binary data.
